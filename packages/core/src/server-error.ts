/**
 * Server-thrown error carrying an HTTP status and a server-computed digest
 * across SSR and SPA navigation.
 *
 * Why a class (not property-stamping):
 * - Mirrors the `FurinNotFoundError` pattern (consistency).
 * - Type-narrowable via `instanceof` and the brand check.
 * - Survives error wrappers (Sentry / monitoring libs that re-throw
 *   `new Error(original.message)` would strip property stamps).
 *
 * Used by:
 * - `FurinErrorBoundary.getDerivedStateFromError` — to honour the server's
 *   digest instead of recomputing one client-side (the latter would produce a
 *   different hash because the public message + synthetic stack differ from the
 *   original server-side error).
 * - SPA navigation: `RouterProvider` throws this during render of the route
 *   position when `__furinError` was sentinelled into the NDJSON payload, so
 *   the nearest error boundary catches it without forcing a full-page reload.
